.. description: Years of dealing with believers who use bad arguments prompted the author to compile a list of characteristics of evidence that, if existant, would convince him of the existence of God. Whether that god deserves worship, on the other hand, is a very different matter...

(Spanish original: :doc:`pruebas`)

After years of answering emails and moderating comments on this site and on `our Facebook page
<https://www.facebook.com/SinDioses.org/>`_, one tends to see that believers' arguments repeat themselves quite often.
Fallacies, appeals to faith, elaborate philosophical constructs, quotes from the founders of various religions, bad
science... the arguments are numerous and exhausting. And that's when they don't machine-gun us with the `Gish gallop
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop>`_, demand definitions in the best style of "sea lions"(see `Why sealioning
is bad <http://simplikation.com/why-sealioning-is-bad/>`_) or accuse us of being atheists because we're possessed by
demons or because we want to sin. Our section "Letters from the Middle Ages" is full of these types of accusations and
bad arguments.

In another article we shared what Richard Dawkins `famously wrote to his daughter regarding this matter`_. Other
atheists have their own responses. At some point, `Matt Dillahunty`_ started responding that he didn't know what
evidence would specifically convince him that the God of the Bible exists, but that, given that this god is omniscient
and omnipotent, he should know what evidence would convince him and should be able to present it, and that if he
didn't, it's because either he doesn't have those attributes and can't, or because he's capricious and doesn't want to.
Of course, the possibility that he doesn't exist is the null hypothesis.

In general I tend to agree with him, but years of discussions have given me some ideas about what characteristics of
such evidence would convince me. So, more than anything to have them compiled in an easy-to-find place, and to use them
as references in my current discussions with believers, I begin here to describe what type of evidence we're talking
about.

Before starting
................

..  admonition:: Warning
    :class: warning

    These are the characteristics that would convince *me*. I don't claim to represent the position of other skeptics.
    I suspect that many will agree with many of my requirements, but there's no guarantee that this will be the case.

*   **Does the god you believe in interact with the real world?** This is important because discussing unverifiable
    constructs bores me. I'm not a philosopher, and I tend to be practical. Without delving into philosophy (which is
    not my favorite discipline), we could say that in practice I use `methodological naturalism`_. I don't go beyond
    that, so those who want to accuse me of `scientism`_ can turn back where they came from; at most, I use
    the **moderate** version of it. That is: If your god does *not* interact with the real world, I'll consider it
    equivalent to Sagan's `dragon in the garage`_, and unworthy of further discussion. I'll continue thinking of that
    god as a rather unpleasant fictional character.

*   **Can we agree that we live in a real world and that you and I share that reality?** It's amazing how many
    people want to validate their god with arguments that basically boil down to "we live in the Matrix." No, I'm not
    interested in that worldview. If you're a solipsist, I can't help or discuss with you. Walk away.

Characteristics your evidence should have
.................................................

*   **It exists in the material world.** Again, philosophy and I are not friends. If you want to discuss the prime
    mover, contingent entities or cosmological arguments, you're barking up the wrong tree. Your evidence must
    be **visible, readable, examinable, detectable or measurable** in some obvious and indisputable way.

*   **It's objective.** An example of something that would *not* be acceptable evidence: The emotions you experience
    exist in the real world (they're chemical processes in your brain), and they're material, but they're entirely
    subjective: no one can experience the same thing as you. The same applies if you hear a voice from beyond the
    grave, if you see something that no one else sees or if you're strongly convinced that something will change your
    life. **Other people should be able to perceive your evidence and evaluate its characteristics in the same way as
    you, because they are obvious due to the nature of that evidence.**

*   **It's reproducible.** Given predictable conditions that can be recreated, the alleged evidence must again be
    available and can be examined in a way that allows determining that it is *material* and *objective*.

*   **It can be examined by skeptics, today.** Even a person who doesn't believe in the conclusion you reached
    can examine your evidence and say "yes, indeed, what is claimed to be occurring is occurring in the terms
    described."

*   **It is totally impossible to confuse this evidence with known natural phenomena.** If what you
    interpret as proof of the supernatural is a known phenomenon or is completely acceptable with a simpler
    explanation, the latter is the one that should be preferred. As `Occam's Razor`_ postulates,

      When two or more explanations of a phenomenon are offered, the simplest **complete** explanation is preferable; that
      is, entities should not be multiplied without necessity.

*   **Your evidence is acceptable to the international scientific consensus** and allows reaching the conclusion you
    propose. That is, when the conditions under which the phenomenon you consider evidence occurs are repeated, it
    either coincides with the scientific paradigm, or challenges it in a plausible way and upon which a reasonable
    hypothesis can be built. However, the theoretical support for that acceptability must exist beforehand. If your
    evidence requires discarding an entire discipline of science that has been repeatedly proven and which supports entire
    notions that are considered valid and successfully predict other related phenomena, you're going to have to do
    a lot of work to justify that your evidence is valid.

*   **Your evidence is acceptable as evidence in a criminal court** and allows reaching the conclusion you propose. And
    in particular I mention criminal law because evidentiary standards tend to be much more strict, requiring the
    absence of doubts in what is postulated. It's not enough for it to be considered probable. [*]_

.. _tldr:

Summary version
................

All of this is very good, but it's a bit lengthy for a café discussion or to respond to a message in a public
forum, especially if you're writing on your mobile phone. If we condense this a bit, we get a phrase very
similar to the one I've used in recent years in the discussions in which I've participated:

..  admonition:: Summary version

    Assuming that you and I live in the real and material world and that your god interacts with that world in a
    detectable way, *what is the material, objective, reproducible evidence that can be examined by skeptics today,
    that your god exists?* That evidence must be impossible to mistake for a natural phenomenon, and be valid both for
    science and in a criminal court of justice.

Perhaps something surprising will happen and someone will present us with evidence of this type. But just in case, don't
hold your breath. It may be quite a while before that happens.

   how improbable such and such phenomenon is should urgently read |innumeracy|_.
